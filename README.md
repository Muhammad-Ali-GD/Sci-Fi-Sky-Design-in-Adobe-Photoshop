Sci-Fi Sky Design in Adobe Photoshop

Design

The design is super simple using just one trick. Choose a moon surface, here I used images from unsplash that is a website that porvides with license free images to use. Import that surface in Adobe Photoshop and use spherize filter found in distort filter in filter panel. Then resize your moon or planet accordingly. Here, I added three moons and a planet. The planet is just an image from unsplash and I did not create it myself.

To make the effect super-realistic I added realistic lighting on the mountains and the tree.
